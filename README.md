# Sudoku Solver
Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. In classic sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9Ã—9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3Ã—3 subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

It loves playing this mind-challenging game, so I thought of automating it using my computer programming skills. So I tried to make this Sudoku game simulation that can provide its solution using the desktop screen.


### PreRequisites
- [X] Python, Tkinter installed

### How to Run
- [X] Run- Python3 main.py
- [ ] Then write Your Sudoku matrix and click next(or enter).

## How to play:
- We can give input using input file or some picture or using your own camera to capture sudoku board.
- Then it read the numbers on that and provide us the solution of the sudoku in output file as well as a tkinter screen.
