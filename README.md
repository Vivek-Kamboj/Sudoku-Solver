# Sudoku Solver
Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. In classic sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9Ã—9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3Ã—3 subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

I loves playing this mind-challenging game, so I thought of automating it using my computer programming skills. So I tried to make this Sudoku game simulation that can provide its solution using the desktop screen.


### PreRequisites
- [X] Python, Tkinter installed

### How to Run
- [X] Run- Python3 main.py
- [X] Here, it will ask for file or pic

## How to play:
```
This is in the beta state, so some of the features may not work.
We are working on them, and they will be available soon.
```
- We can give input using an input file or some picture or using your own camera to capture the sudoku board.
- Then, it read the numbers and provides the desktop interface.
- We can play the sudoku in this interface.
- On Clicking get a result, it provides us the sudoku solution in the output file as well as in a Tkinter screen.
